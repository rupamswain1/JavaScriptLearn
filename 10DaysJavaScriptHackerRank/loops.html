    <h1>Loops</h1>
    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Objective

        In this challenge, we practice looping over the characters of string. Check out the attached tutorial for more
        details.
        <br>
        <strong>Task</strong>
        <br>
        Complete the vowelsAndConsonants function in the editor below.
        <br>
        It has one parameter, a string,

        , consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z). The function must do the following:

        First, print each vowel in

        on a new line. The English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it
        appeared in
        .
        <br>
        Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in
        on a new line in the same order as it appeared in

        .
        <br>
        <strong>Input Format</strong>
        <br>
        Locked stub code in the editor reads string

        from stdin and passes it to the function.
        <br>
        <strong>Output Format</strong>
        <br>
        First, print each vowel in
        on a new line (in the same order as they appeared in ). Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in on a
        new line (in the same order as they appeared in ).</p>
